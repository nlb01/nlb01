### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ I am a Software Developer who is very eager to put all the skills and strategies I have learned to use in order to make mindblowing products with amazing teams.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focused on web development with Node Js as the main tech.
- âš¡ Fun fact: If there's one thing I love more than computer science, that would be sports. I would love to do something that combines thoese two fields, so if you got any ideas...I am the person to talk to.
